**Code Integration:**

In your `App.js`, you will manage the state of your items and implement the `moveItem` function to handle moving items between lists:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { DndProvider } from "react-dnd";
import { HTML5Backend } from "react-dnd-html5-backend";
import DropZone from "./DropZone";

const App = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState({
    left: ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"],
    right: ["Item 4", "Item 5"],
  });

  const moveItem = (item, from, to) => {
    setItems((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [from]: prev[from].filter((i) => i !== item),
      [to]: [...prev[to], item],
    }));
  };

  return (
    <DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>
      <div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-around" }}>
        <DropZone
          items={items.left}
          onDrop={(item) => moveItem(item, "right", "left")}
          title="Left List"
        />
        <DropZone
          items={items.right}
          onDrop={(item) => moveItem(item, "left", "right")}
          title="Right List"
        />
      </div>
    </DndProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In `DraggableItem.js`, make each item draggable using `useDrag`:

```javascript
// DraggableItem.js
import React from "react";
import { useDrag } from "react-dnd";

const DraggableItem = ({ item }) => {
  const [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag(() => ({
    type: "ITEM",
    item: { name: item },
    collect: (monitor) => ({
      isDragging: monitor.isDragging(),
    }),
  }));

  return (
    <div
      ref={drag}
      style={{
        opacity: isDragging ? 0.5 : 1,
        cursor: "move",
        padding: "8px",
        margin: "4px",
        backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0",
        borderRadius: "4px",
      }}
    >
      {item}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DraggableItem;
```

In `DropZone.js`, set up the drop targets using `useDrop`:

```javascript
// DropZone.js
import React from "react";
import { useDrop } from "react-dnd";
import DraggableItem from "./DraggableItem";

const DropZone = ({ items, onDrop, title }) => {
  const [{ isOver }, drop] = useDrop(() => ({
    accept: "ITEM",
    drop: (item) => onDrop(item.name),
    collect: (monitor) => ({
      isOver: monitor.isOver(),
    }),
  }));

  return (
    <div
      ref={drop}
      style={{
        width: "200px",
        padding: "16px",
        backgroundColor: isOver ? "#e0e0e0" : "#f8f8f8",
        borderRadius: "8px",
      }}
    >
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <DraggableItem key={index} item={item} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DropZone;
```

In `index.js`, render the `App` component:

```javascript
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

reportWebVitals();
```

**Testing Drag-and-Drop Functionality:**

In `App.test.js`, write tests to ensure that items move correctly between lists when dragged and dropped. You'll need to mock the drag-and-drop backend for testing purposes.

```javascript
// App.test.js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders Left List and Right List', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const leftListElement = screen.getByText(/Left List/i);
  const rightListElement = screen.getByText(/Right List/i);
  expect(leftListElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(rightListElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**Additional Files:**

- **reportWebVitals.js:** Used for measuring performance in your app.
- **setupTests.js:** Configures the testing environment using Jest and React Testing Library.

**Accessibility Considerations:**

- Use ARIA roles and attributes to improve accessibility.
- Provide keyboard interaction alternatives for drag-and-drop operations.
- Ensure focus management is handled appropriately during interactions.

**Performance Optimization:**

- Memoize components that do not need to re-render on every state change.
- Use `React.memo` for `DraggableItem` and `DropZone` components.
- Ensure that the `moveItem` function is wrapped with `useCallback` if necessary.

**Deployment and Continuous Integration:**

- Set up GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on each push.
- Deploy the application to a platform like Netlify or Vercel.
- Configure the deployment to trigger on successful builds.

**Final Documentation:**

- Include setup instructions in the README.
- Document the application architecture and component hierarchy.
- Provide guidance on how to run tests and interpret results.

---

This addition also reinforces best practices in testing, accessibility, and performance optimization, ensuring that students are well-prepared for real-world web development challenges.
