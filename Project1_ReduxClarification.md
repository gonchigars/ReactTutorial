First, let's create the app without Redux:

```javascript
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
      <CounterActions reset={reset} />
    </div>
  );
};

const CounterActions = ({ reset }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter Actions</h2>
      <ResetButton reset={reset} />
    </div>
  );
};

const ResetButton = ({ reset }) => {
  return <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>;
};

export default App;

```

Now, let's create the same app using Redux:

```javascript
// actions.js
export const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
export const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';
export const RESET = 'RESET';

export const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });
export const decrement = () => ({ type: DECREMENT });
export const reset = () => ({ type: RESET });

// reducer.js
import { INCREMENT, DECREMENT, RESET } from './actions';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

const rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case DECREMENT:
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    case RESET:
      return { ...state, count: 0 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default rootReducer;

// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { Provider, useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducer';
import { increment, decrement, reset } from './actions';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Counter />
    </Provider>
  );
};

const Counter = () => {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
      <CounterActions />
    </div>
  );
};

const CounterActions = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter Actions</h2>
      <ResetButton />
    </div>
  );
};

const ResetButton = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  return <button onClick={() => dispatch(reset())}>Reset</button>;
};

export default App;

```

Now, let's compare these two approaches and explain the benefits of using Redux:

1. **State Management**:
   - Without Redux: State is managed in the top-level App component using useState hook.
   - With Redux: State is managed in a centralized store, separate from the components.

2. **Prop Drilling**:
   - Without Redux: The `reset` function needs to be passed down through `CounterActions` to reach `ResetButton`.
   - With Redux: No prop drilling is necessary. `ResetButton` can access the `reset` action directly.

3. **Component Coupling**:
   - Without Redux: Child components (`CounterActions`, `ResetButton`) depend on props passed from parent components.
   - With Redux: Components are decoupled. They interact with the store independently.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Without Redux: As the app grows, more props might need to be passed down, increasing complexity.
   - With Redux: New state or actions can be added to the store without changing the component hierarchy.

5. **Predictability**:
   - Without Redux: State changes happen directly in components.
   - With Redux: All state changes are centralized in the reducer, making them more predictable and easier to track.

6. **Ease of Testing**:
   - Without Redux: Components with state are harder to test in isolation.
   - With Redux: Pure reducer functions are easy to test. Components can be tested in isolation more easily.

7. **Developer Tools**:
   - Without Redux: Debugging state changes can be challenging, especially in larger apps.
   - With Redux: Powerful developer tools allow for easy debugging, time-travel, and state inspection.

8. **Middleware Support**:
   - Without Redux: Implementing cross-cutting concerns (like logging) is more challenging.
   - With Redux: Middleware provides a powerful way to handle side effects and cross-cutting concerns.

In this simple example, the benefits of Redux might seem small. However, as applications grow in complexity, these benefits become more pronounced:

- The ability to access state or dispatch actions from any component without prop drilling becomes increasingly valuable.
- Centralized state management makes it easier to implement features like undo/redo or state persistence.
- The clear separation of concerns (components for UI, actions for describing changes, reducers for handling changes) leads to more maintainable code.

While Redux does add some initial complexity and boilerplate, it provides a scalable and maintainable solution for state management in larger applications. However, for simpler applications, the built-in React state management (useState, useReducer, useContext) might be sufficient.
